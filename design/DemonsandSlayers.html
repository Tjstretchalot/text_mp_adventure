<h1>Demons and Slayers</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<p><strong>Mechanic Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chance to failure stacks multiplicatively. If you have a 30% chance to fail
an action and another 50% chance to fail, then you have <code>0.3 + (0.5 * 0.7) = 0.65</code>
65% chance of failure. Note order doesn't matter; <code>0.5 + (0.3 * 0.5) = 0.65</code>.</li>
<li>Movement takes you from one zone to another adjacent zone. The map specifies
the time during the movement that is inside the first location and the time
during the movement that is inside the second location. Movements may not be
cancelled for any reason. The player is prevented from moving through impassable
locations, but if a location becomes impassable during a move the player
is immediately returned to his starting location and told why.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay Notes</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated,</p>
<ul>
<li>All players may move between locations. Moving takes time (see map). Players
are alerted to movements through their location according to the light level.</li>
<li>All players with vision on a location have a chance to see any actions
by players in that location, according to the light level.</li>
<li>All abilities may be used once per cycle. Players with two abilities may
use both. Abilities act instantly unless they state otherwise.</li>
<li>All players have <strong>Short Sleep</strong>: Sleep for 3 hours (11.25s at night, 16.875s
at day). Players do not receive messages while sleeping, may be tied up by a
single player, and do not defend attacks.</li>
<li>All players have <strong>Long Sleep</strong>: Sleep for 6 hours (22.5s at night, 33.75s
at day). Players do not receive messages while sleeping, may be tied up by a
single player, and do not defend attacks.</li>
<li>All demons give off a demonic trace in any location they enter, lasting one
cycle.</li>
<li>All demons have the ability <strong>Prove Demon</strong> which proves they are a demon
to everyone in the location. <strong>Prove Demon</strong> does not have a cooldown.</li>
<li>Some locations are consecrated. In these locations, demons:
<ul>
<li>use <strong>Prove Demon</strong> at start of day, with 5% chance of failure, boosted by
by the Twin Witches <strong>Bless</strong></li>
<li>cannot voluntarily enter</li>
<li>have a 20% chance of death at start of day</li>
<li>have an 80% chance of failure for all actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players may be tied up. When tied up, players have a 95% chance to fail all
actions unless freed. Tying up requires 1 hour (3.75s at night, 5.625s at day),
freeing is instant. Both require physical contact. Movement within zones is
instant once you arrive. It requires 3 players to tie up one other player.</li>
</ul>
<p>Locations have a light level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brightly lit (sunny, standard clouds, torches, lighting)</li>
<li>Dimly lit (shadows) - 50% chance to detect other players</li>
<li>Darkness (inside without lighting) - 10% chance to detect other players.
50% chance of failure for all actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players have a sleep requirement. They must sleep at least 6 hours (20s at
night or 34s at day) per day or suffer one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion is
cleared after 6 hours of rest.
Exhaustion levels are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tired</strong>: 30% chance of failure on all actions</li>
<li><strong>Fatigued</strong>: 50% chance of failure on all actions</li>
<li><strong>Exhausted</strong>: 80% chance of failure on all actions, 50% chance to rest for the
entire period at start at night and start of day.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are up to 12 players per round, 5 demons, 5 slayers, and 2 neutral. There
are also at least 20 non-player characters with no specialty. It is expected
that players will attempt to disguise themselves as these NPCs.</p>
<h1>Demons</h1>
<h2>Main Objective</h2>
<p>Assemble the 8 bones of the powerful ancient demon Gonthu to resurrect him,
restarting his reign. If both <strong>Twin Witches</strong> die, the demons can still force
a draw by killing all non-demon players.</p>

</ol>
<h3>Beelzebub</h3>
<p>A beelzebub is a false god or idolator, and typically acts as a decision maker
for the demons and spreads information.</p>
<h4>Day Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Disguise</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Does not have a demonic trace. May enter consecrated
locations.</li>
<li><strong>Darkness Adept</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Can see in all rooms as if they were one
light level higher (no change for Brightly lit)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Night Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Disguise</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Does not have a demonic trace. May enter consecrated
locations.</li>

specialization.</li>
<li><strong>Darkness Adept</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Can see in all rooms as if they were one
light level higher (no change for Brightly lit)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Moving Shadow</h3>
<p>The moving shadow cannot move into the light; it is killed if in a location
that has a light level of Dimly lit or higher. It waits, haunting anyone that enters
its location. Automatic lighting does not work in locations with a Moving Shadow.
Upon approval of the Moving Shadow, dead demons may assist it by using the Haunt
command as if they were the moving shadow.</p>
<p>At worst, a moving shadow acts as another source of <strong>Curse</strong> and as a way to
communicate with the dead. At best, it can cause humans to kill each other. The
moving shadow strongly incentivizes meeting outdoors or in consecrated locations.</p>
<h4>Day Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Haunt</strong>: Invade the conscious of the target player. Send
him a message as if they were from another player or from the system. Demons
are told that it is a moving shadow, allowing for targeted communication.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Haunt</strong>: Only usable on humans with <strong>Curse</strong> during the day. See
night ability for usage.</li>
<li><strong>Darkness Master</strong>: <em>Passive</em> No penalties from light levels</li>
<li><strong>Restless</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Is not affected by exhaustion.</li>
<li><strong>Commune</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Can speak with dead demons.</li>
<li><strong>Bringer of Darkness</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Automatic lighting does not work in
the Moving Shadows location.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Night Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enhanced Haunt</strong>: Same as haunt, except that, for humans, all messages (from
anything other than moving shadows) are sent to the Moving Shadow instead of the
human, including day/night cycles. Also applies <strong>Curse</strong> (see Twin Witch) if
they do not already have it. Commands either have controls for overrides or
are not affected, to prevent them being used to detect a Moving Shadow. While a
moving shadow is able to use Enhanced Haunt on a human, the human is told the
room is Brightly Lit.</li>
<li><strong>Darkness Master</strong>: <em>Passive</em> No penalties from light levels</li>
<li><strong>Restless</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Is not affected by exhaustion.</li>
<li><strong>Commune</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Can speak with dead demons.</li>
<li><strong>Bringer of Darkness</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Automatic lighting does not work in
the Moving Shadows location.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Twin Witch</h3>
<p>The twin witch is guaranteed and always starts in pairs, with knowledge of who
the other is. The twin witches are capable of resurrecting Gonthu when they have
all their bones and serve as a powerful offensive with <strong>Curse</strong> that is hard to
trace since it only requires a name. Additionally, <strong>Bless</strong> can serve as an
incredibly strong bluffing tool since it helps the target resist <strong>Prove Demon</strong>
from consecrated locations.</p>
<h4>Day Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resurrect</strong>: Requires a complete set of bones for Gonthu. Starts the reign
of Gonthu (requires 3 hours, 16.875s). Demons win if you do this.</li>
<li><strong>Curse</strong>: Curses the target human, giving them a 2% chance to die
on start of day, doubling each day. Shares a cooldown with <strong>Bless</strong>. Does <em>not</em>
require physical access. The target is alerted on the 5th day of a curse (next
day is 64% chance of death) or 50% of the time when entering consecrated
locations (with a maximum of one roll per cycle).
They also have the same chance of failure as the followings days death chance.</li>
<li><strong>Bless</strong>: Blesses the target demon. Starts with 0 uses available, shares
a cooldown with <strong>Curse</strong>. Requires physical access, and grants the target
demon 25% resistance to failure (subtractive; if they had a net chance of
failure of 65% they will have a net chance of failure of 90% after). A demon
may only blessed once, may target the twin witch.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Night Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sacrifice</strong>: The target tied up human is sacrificed for Gonthu, killing
the target and tells you the location of a piece of Gonthu's body that you have
not infused yet.</li>
<li><strong>Infuse</strong>: The target bone of Gonthu is infused with power. Bones may only
be infused once per witch. For each infused bone, <strong>Curse</strong> starts one day later
and the witch is given one use of <strong>Bless</strong>. Both twin witches may infuse a bone,
gaining the effect separately.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Demogorgon</h3>
<p>Acting as a defensive force, typically assigned to the twin witch, the
demogorgon is too strong to attack head on and provides essential escape
abilities to key demons. The demogorgon still has to sleep</p>
<h4>Day Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Alert</strong>: <em>Passive</em> All attacks on the demogorgons location only attack
the demogorgon. Works even when sleeping.</li>
<li><strong>Strong</strong>: <em>Passive</em> All attacks on a demogorgon have an additional 25% chance
of failure per demon in the demogorgons location, including the demogorgon,
stacking multiplicatively. Does not work when sleeping.</li>
<li><strong>Teleport</strong>: Move the demogorgon and any demons in the same location to any <strong>Outskirts</strong>
location. Is not affected by the normal failure chance from being tied up.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Night Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Alert</strong>: <em>Passive</em> All attacks on the demogorgons location only attack
the demogorgon. Works even when sleeping.</li>
<li><strong>Strong</strong>: <em>Passive</em> All attacks on a demogorgon have an additional 25% chance
of failure per demon in the demogorgons location, including the demogorgon,
stacking multiplicatively. Does not work when sleeping.</li>
<li><strong>Teleport</strong>: Move the demogorgon and any demons in the same location to any <strong>Outskirts</strong>
location. Is not affected by the normal failure chance from being tied up.</li>
<li><strong>Sacrifice</strong>: The demogorgon gains <strong>Restless</strong>: <em>Passive</em> is not affected
by exhaustion. However, the demogorgon dies on the start of the 4th day following
this ability (including the next morning). Sacrifice can only be used once.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cursed Soul</h3>
<p>The cursed soul acts as an alternative method to the Shapeshifter for acquiring
bones. The cursed soul does not have the similiar detection reduction, but
<strong>Hustle</strong> can make him harder to catch.</p>
<h4>Day Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Search</strong>: Search the target location for any bones of Gonthu. Requires
physical contact.</li>
<li><strong>Hustle</strong>: The next movement happens at double speed. If tied, breaks
free without the failure chance from tied up, but has an additional 50% chance
to fail.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Night Abilities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Search</strong>: Search the target location for any bones of Gonthu. Requires
physical contact.</li>
<li><strong>Darkness Adept</strong>: <em>Passive</em> Can see in all rooms as if they were one light
level higher (no change for Brightly lit)</li>
</ol>
